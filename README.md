# jacoco-report

This is a forked GitHub action that I've modified for a personal project. It publishes the JaCoCo report as a comment in the Pull Request, providing customizable pass percentages for modified modules, files, and the overall project. A new feature I've added is the ability to view the coverage of just the changed files in your pull request, as well as an additional output parameter.

For the orignal project go to [Madrapps/jacoco-report](https://github.com/Madrapps/jacoco-report)

## Usage
